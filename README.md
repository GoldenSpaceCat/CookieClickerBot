# GottZ CookieClicker Bot

## Installation
If you want to install it in Tampermonkey or similar, just click this [link](https://github.com/GoldenSpaceCat/CookieClickerBot/raw/master/CookieClickerBot.user.js).  
STEAM Workshop will come within Q3 or Q4 of 2023. read on, to know why.

## motivation
I like running this in background.  
I also value my time, so by automating several parts of this game, the goal of a true idle experience comes closer without spoiling the fun too much.  
It still takes a ton of time to complete the game with this, so I don't consider it to be a true "cheat" but merely a slight speed bump with auto play characteristics.  
I can essentially sit back and watch it play itself at this point.  
I do have to make several decisions myself. (I have to click research for ex)  
  
To enable it, just hover over the `Options` button with your Mouse after installation:

Additionally, it technically CAN be used in the Steam release without modification:

I don't plan on putting it onto the Steam workshop asap tho, since it would definitely be considered cheating.  
Why do I care you may ask?  
Simply because I don't think plebs should cheat Achievements without knowing how to cheat on their own.  
I will publish it on steam eventually but it will definitely flag your save as cheater if you enable "cheat mode".  
You will have to figure out how to disable it, if you want steam achievements. ;)  
I will publish after a re-write.  
This re-write will also tap into the mod interface rather than exploiting the game in ways, even the devs wouldn't guess.

### Note: To ensure passive bonus is kept as long as possible, this is only ran in the instant the garden ticks.

## ToDo:
- [ ] auto planting in spare space, to prevent the grid from dieing out
- [ ] auto buy and sell for stonks
- [ ] refactoring the code from PoC to something managable
- [ ] Steam Workshop release with cheat / no-cheat modes.
